# KeyFinder
The code to run my mass key finder on Instructables

My Dad owns and manages a lot of apartments and needs to be able to quickly find the right keys to each unit. 
Tagging each key works alright when you only have a few of them, but it can get harder to search for them when there are many.
This project uses RFID to identify the keys stuck to the key hanger with magnets. The list of keys can be accessed through a node-red server.
Clicking on a key listed in the table flashes the LED above the right key.
